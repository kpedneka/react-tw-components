## Description
A responsive React component library that uses Tailwind CSS. The main goal is to create fully responsive components that support flexibility and also custom themes.
See the [example](https://github.com/kpedneka/react-tw-components/blob/basic-elements/example/src/App.js) for how you can use these components and also customize the theme to suit your style.

Now supports dark mode based on system theme!

This library is under active development. It's my first contribution to open source, so I appreciate your patience as I iron out the bugs and design. 
I'm very open to contributors and working on new features. Keep in touch, happy hacking!
