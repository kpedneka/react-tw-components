When working on an issue, please follow the standard fork and pull request guidelines:

* If you are working on a feature, please make sure that your naming convention is consistent with other components
* **Pretty please** update [DOCUMENTATION.md](https://github.com/kpedneka/react-tw-components/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md) and [the example](https://github.com/kpedneka/react-tw-components/blob/main/example/src/App.js) as necessary. 
* Please run prettier to standardise the formatting of your code:
